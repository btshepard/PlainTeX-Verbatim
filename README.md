### PlainTeX Verbatim

This is a TeX package that provides commands for producing verbatim environments in plain TeX documents. They also may be used in LaTeX, although it is not recommended (the commands used are fragile and may not be compatible with certain LaTeX packages). For a detailed description and example usage, see `verbatim.pdf`.
